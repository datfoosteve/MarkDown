## Description

> Hello, welcome to my program,
> This program allows you to generate a professional README.md without having to worry about conversions of syntax and editing for Markdown. This program will use  Inquirer prompts, template literals, and with the user input, to ask you questions, while node Js does most of the work here to organize all the information and send information between files. Inquirer not only allows you to organize questions with answer choices but allows ffor choice lists and eve a  text editor to appear on screen to record paragraph long responses or mutiple choices.  With the responses being stored in objects and arrays, also allows you to then produce conditions where more comoplicated things get be generated.  And in my case I used confirm statements to ask the user what parts of the readme.md file they want to generate with a Table of contents generating as well. You can generate badges depending on user choices as well. The beauty of this is being able to run this for any project and the ability to add on just to make git projects have clean and concise Readme files. I want to finish this program one day where i can point basically this program to any project and then be able to generate readmes as as script, and have the ability to use the file explorer to search images. Thank you for looking at my project

## Installation

> To install this program, you must either download the repository. Then open it up using a IDE that uses Node.js, Open it up to the root, and then run the "index.js" from
> a node.js Command line. Otherwise, the user can copy the code, but if that's the case, then make sure you install the same dependencies listed in the package. Json.
> Am always looking to make this better, feel free to take it apart and change things up.,Have not made this an executable, yet but will work on it


## Usage

> This is as simple as just running it in command line as long as the file has an output path that is similar to the one in this file structure. Or go into indexs and rewrite the write file path.
> All you would have to do after that is just run index.js in node and then answer the prompts like how I am doing right now by using this program.
